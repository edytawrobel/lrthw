list of commands to call on files to remember:

close -- Closes the file. Like File->Save.. in your editor.
read -- Reads the contents of the file. You can assign the result to a variable.
readline -- Reads just one line of a text file.
truncate -- Empties the file. Watch out if you care about the file.
write('stuff') -- Writes "stuff" to the file.
File.exist?(to_file)
f.readline() - you're reading a line from the file, moving the read head to right after the \\n that ends that line

The most important modifiers to know: the + modifier, so you can do 'w+', 'r+', and 'a+'.
This will open the file in both read and write mode, and depending on the character use position the file in different ways.

\tThe lovely world
with logic so firmly planted
cannot discern \n the needs of love
nor comprehend passion from intuition
and requires an explanation
\n\t\twhere there is none.
END
